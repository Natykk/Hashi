rules = Hashi is a puzzle game which consists of connecting islands together with bridges by following the following rules:\n\n1. Bridges must be horizontal or vertical and do not cross each other.\n\n2. There can be at most two bridges between two given islands.\n\n3. Each island is assigned a number between 1 and 8 representing the number of bridges to which it must be connected.\n\nWe must be able to connect all the islands together using bridges.
help = The techniques

technique1  = Explanation: Iles avec 4 dans le coin 6 sur le cote et 8 au milieu : \n\n Une ile dans un coin ne peut pas avoir plus de deux voisines et le nombre de ponts vers chaque voisin ne peut pas etre superieur a 2. Par consequent l'ile dans le coin avec l'indice 4 doit avoir deux ponts relies a chacun de ses deux voisins. De meme l'ile du cote du puzzle avec l'indice 6 doit avoir deux ponts relies a chacun de ses trois voisins et l'ile du milieu du puzzle avec l'indice 8 doit avoir deux ponts relies a chacun de ses quatre voisins. Dans tous les cas le nombre total de ponts est connecte ce qui signifie que les iles peuvent etre marquees d'un X
technique2  = Explanation: Islands with a single neighbor: \n\n The island containing 1 in the bottom row has only one neighbor on its right, which means we must connect a single bridge between these islands. Similarly, the island containing 2 on the top-right has only one neighbor underneath, which means we must connect two bridges between these islands. In both cases the island containing 1 and the island containing 2 are completed, which means they can be marked with an X. Note that an island with a single neighbor can never contain 3 or higher because this will violate the rules of Hashi.
technique3  = Explanation: Islands with 3 in the corner, 5 on the side and 7 in the middle: \n\n An island in a corner with the clue 3 must have two neighbors, with one bridge connected to one neighbor and two bridges connected to the other neighbor. Although we don’t know which neighbor has two bridges, we can be certain there is at least one bridge in each direction as seen with the island in the bottom left corner of this example. Similarly an island on the side of the puzzle with the clue 5 must have at least one bridge connected to each of its three neighbors and an island in the middle of the puzzle with the clue 7 must have at least one bridge connected to each of its four neighbors.
technique4  = Explanation: Special cases of 3 in the corner, 5 on the side and 7 in the middle: \n\n If an island in a corner has a clue 3 and one of its neighbors is an island with the clue 1, then all conditions are met and three bridges can be drawn. The same logic can be applied if an island on the side of the puzzle with the clue 5 or if an island in the middle of the puzzle with the clue 7 have a neighboring island with the clue 1.
technique5  = Explanation: Special case of 4 on the side: \n\n In this example we can see an island with a clue 4 in the second row from the bottom. Although the 4 is not on the side of the puzzle, from a logic point of view we can treat it as such because it has neighbors on three sides only. Since no more than two bridges are allowed in the same direction, all conditions are satisfied and four bridges can be drawn: two bridges to the island above, and one bridge to each of the islands on the sides.
technique6  = Explanation: Special case of 6 in the middle: \n\n Let’s assume the island with the clue 6 is connected to the island with the clue 1. This leaves five bridges, which means there must be at least one bridge connected to islands A, B and C. Now let’s assume the island with the clue 6 is not connected to the island with the clue 1. In this case exactly two bridges must be connected to islands A, B and C. So, regardless of whether or not the island with the clue 6 is connected to the island with the clue 1, there must be at least one bridge connected to islands A, B and C.
technique7  = Explanation: Isolation of a two-island segment: \n\n Let’s look at the bottom island with the clue 1 in the right hand column. If we connect it to the other island with the clue 1 as shown in the left diagram then the two islands will become an isolated segment which is not allowed according to the rules of Hashi. So the only other possibility is to connect it to island A. For the same reason the island with the clue 2 in the bottom-left corner cannot be connected with the two bridges to the island on its right as shown in the left diagram. This means that at least one bridge must be connected from the island in the bottom-left corner to island B.
technique8  = Explanation: Isolation of a three-island segment: \n\n The above technique can be expanded to segments with three islands. The island with the clue 2 in the bottom row cannot be connected with two bridges as shown in the left diagram because it would then become an isolated 1-2-1 segment. This means there must be at least one bridge to island A. Similarly, the island with the clue 3 in the left column cannot be connected with three bridges as shown in the left diagram because it would then become an isolated 1-3-2 segment. This means there must be at least one bridge to island B.
technique9  = Explanation: Isolation when a segment connects to an island: \n\n Sometimes much longer island segments may become isolated creating logic situations which are harder to find and more interesting to solve. Let’s look at the example in the diagram on the left. What we see is a segment made up of seven islands, where six of the islands are completed and only the island with the clue 3 in the top row has one bridge missing. If we connect this bridge to the island in the top-left corner according to the red line, then we will end up with an isolated segment. Therefore this bridge must be connected to the island with the clue 5 as shown in the diagram on the right.
technique10 = Explanation: Isolation when a segment connects to another segment: \n\n In the left diagram we have two segments, one made up of four islands where all islands are completed except the island with the clue 6, and the other made up of eight islands where all islands are also completed except the island with the clue 3. In both segments, the uncompleted islands are missing exactly two bridges. Now, if we were to connect two bridges between these two segments according to the red lines, we will end up with a long isolated segment. Therefore we can deduct that at least one bridge must be connected to the top-left island as shown in the diagram on the right.
